# What is Java?

Java is a programming language, designed to be concurrent, class-based and object-oriented, as well as a computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. An enormous amount of applications and websites will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Denying yourself Java is akin to denying yourself access to a technological infrastructure. Java is advertised, and esteemed for its fast performance, security, and reliability.
